# Pokétch Clock
A repository for [poketchclock](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1354293), an analogue clock composed using p5.js. Created as an assignment for Creative Coding (DGST 302) at the University of Mary Washington.

## Background and Function
The clock face itself is inspired by the Pokétch analogue clock application in Pokémon Platinum. A blue tone was selected, and each hour is represented by individual squares instead of numbers.

*the clock only features hands for hours and minutes to keep the spirit of the original. A link to the sketch can be found by clicking on the embeded hyperlink attached to 'poketchclock' or by simply clicking the link below.*

## Feats, Struggles, and Reflection
Given the time restraints I found myself in with gathering information about the creation of clocks in a p5.js environment, I opted to go with my initial idea of developing a Pokétch inspired clock for this project. I attempted to first imitate the digital clock application, with the Pokétch font being used. However, I experienced several errors when developing the digital clock that I decided to instead recreate the analogue clock face. I found better success with this approach, and, with help from Daniel Shiffman's Coding Train videos on the use of p5.js' time functions, I was able to fully capture the recreation. All colors align with the original and the Pokétch exterior body itself was added to add further immersion.
